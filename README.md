Bugs


Done
- Reduce frequency of golden ball spawning
- Increase spawner frequency after x score
- Timer until GoldenBall buff expires
- Greenball sometimes passes through player (prob)

TO DO
- End game screen and menu(10 negative points or 3 negative points back to back)
- Start game menu
- Touch controls suck

Future ideas
- Speed new balls after x score points
- Middle line Redball to show which side it will move when close
- After x balls player missed, deduce points and/or change player color
