# Bucket-Catch
3D platform game

Bugs
- Greenball sometimes passes through player


TO DO
- End game screen and menu(10 negative points or 3 negative points back to back)
- Start game menu
- Reduce frequency of golden ball spawning
- Touch controls suck
- Art


Future ideas
- Speed new balls after x score points
- Middle line Redball to show which side it will move when close
- Timer untill GoldenBall buff expires
- After x balls player missed, deduce points and/or change player color
